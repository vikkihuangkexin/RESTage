# RESTage
An enhanced language model to immune resilience in aging based on single cell sequencing

Aging leads to the accumulation of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs), which exert chronic immunosuppressive effects and impair T cell activation, survival, and effector function. This progressive dysfunction undermines immune surveillance and reduces the efficacy of immunotherapies in older individuals. Here, we present RESTage, an immune resilience evaluation framework employing a multi-task transformer trained on single-cell transcriptomic profiles from diverse immune tissues, which identifies resilience markers with the potential to resist aging-associated SASP-mediated suppression (https://relab.xidian.edu.cn/RESTage/).

RESTage employs multi-task learning and attention mechanisms to model high-order interactions between SASP genes and immune transcriptional states, enabling the identification of key markers that confer functional resistance to immunosuppression.
